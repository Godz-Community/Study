# Study

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to share knowledge. In here, people can create folders for technologies, such as JavaScript, ReactJS, Solidity, etc.

## How to Contribute
1. Message any of the people that are already a part of this organization on [discord](http://discord.gg/godsgame), so they can add you to the organization. 
2. Once you're added, you can create new folders or just open one that already exists for that technology.
3. You can create Markdown files, such as this one, with summaries about a given subject. For example, in a Python folder, in a variables.md file, you can write "ints: integer numbers, strings: ..." and so on. 
4. You can also paste links for useful materials, like documentation, youtube videos, websites, etc.

This way, you will be helping not only yourself, but everyone who wants to learn more about a subject!
